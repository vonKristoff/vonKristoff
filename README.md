### Hi there 👋

I’m a Front-End Engineer with over a decade of hands-on experience with Agile user stories (sizing, writing, reviewing, collaborating and comitting) into clean, maintainable, undoubtably accessible interfaces. I love working with Product, QA and Designers, and being able to deliver quality components and integrations. I am always open to trying something new and finding the right tool for the stack, especially the one that fits both the job and the team. That being said, it all begins somewhere with an Idea, and TypeScript.

🛠️ **Tech & Tools**  
Deep experience across modern frameworks (Svelte, Astro, React) and tooling like Docker, GitHub Actions, AWS, Fly.io, and private server setups. I’m comfortable contributing across the entire delivery pipeline — from code to deployment.

🎮 **Recent Work** 
Game: oruggintrail.com | Itch.io September 2025
At a games company, I collaborated closely with Product to explore agentic user experiences — building features powered by LLMs to enable client-driven dynamic functionality. We released The Oruggin Trail - a text based adventure game!

🛒 **Vodafone**  
Lead of a team of 10 developers on the checkout flow. Maintained quality, pushed for best practices, and won the company’s most prestigious hackathon.
Also we detected a mobile data dropoff, which we improved to claim a 1% increase in yearly sales! 

🧩 **MMT | MSQ | A26**  
Worked as an internal contractor, jumping across projects: building components from design systems, prepping for CMS integration, and helping develop an in-house React component library.

🌐 **ScanLAB Projects**  
Delivered immersive, full-stack web experiences that brought complex spatial data to life.

🔭 **What’s Next?**  
I'm particularly excited about building **Local-First**, real-time collaborative applications — fast, resilient, and built for the edge. 

Other than what's on the horizon, I cannot forget what got me to where I am today, which is building Websites - I still love doing that, and am always excited on building a portfolio / blog or SPA!
